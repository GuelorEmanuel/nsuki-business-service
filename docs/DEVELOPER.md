## The Elixir Style Guide

This is the style guide that we are following for this project [elixir style guide](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide)

## Development Environment

I highly recommend installing Elixir (and Erlang) using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/), to manage Elixir/Erlang versions
1. Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm)

On a new terminal, install Erlang and Elixir plugins:

```bash
asdf plugin-add erlang
asdf plugin-add elixir
```

## Install Erlang and Elixir

```bash
asdf install erlang 22.2.7
asdf install elixir 1.10.3-otp-22
```
Then set them as the global version:
```bash
asdf global erlang 22.2.7
asdf global elixir 1.10.3-otp-22
```
